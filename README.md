# Liaster
Playlist Creation Tool
#### If you want to be able to run liaster anywhere then put a directory with a liaster (variant) inside of your PATH environment variable; very similar to setting up a command line applications; unsurprisingly.

#### You can avoid having to type perl every time you want to run a Perl script on Windows by adding the .pl file extension to the PATHEXT environment variable. Here's how:

Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".

Click on "Edit the system environment variables".

Click on the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom of the "System Properties" window.

In the "User variables" section, click the "New" button to create a new variable.

Enter PATHEXT as the variable name and .PL as the variable value (separated by a semicolon from any existing values).

Click "OK" to save the new environment variable.

Once you've added the .PL file extension to PATHEXT, Windows will automatically recognize Perl scripts with that extension as executable files. You can then run the script from the command prompt without typing perl. For example, if you have a Perl script named myscript.pl, you can run it by typing myscript on the command line (without the .pl extension).

Note that adding the .PL extension to PATHEXT will make all Perl scripts with that extension executable, so make sure your Perl scripts are named appropriately and located in a secure directory.
